Example1 : Scanning for a single port on a machine

nmap –p portnumber hostname

Example:

nmap -p 53 192.168.0.1

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for localhost (192.168.0.1)
Host is up (0.000042s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open domain

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.04 seconds

The above example will try to check 53(DNS) port is open on 192.168.0.1 port or not.

Example2 : Scan entire machine for checking open ports.

nmap hostname

Example:

nmap 192.168.0.1

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for localhost (192.168.0.1)
Host is up (0.00037s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open domain
631/tcp open ipp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds

Example3 : Scan remote machine for open ports

nmap remote-ip/host

Example:

nmap 192.168.0.2

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for localhost (192.168.0.2)
Host is up (0.00037s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open domain
631/tcp open ipp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds

Example4: Scan entire network for IP address and open ports.

nmap network ID/subnet-mask

Example:

nmap 192.168.1.0/24

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.016s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open telnet
53/tcp open domain
80/tcp open http
5000/tcp open upnp

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.2
Host is up (0.036s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.2 are closed

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.3
Host is up (0.000068s latency).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.3 are closed

Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 22.19 seconds

Example5: Scan just ports, dont scan for IP address, hardware address, hostname, operating system name, version, and uptime etc. It’s very much fast as it said in man pages etc. We observed in our tests that it is 70% faster in scan ports when compared to normal scan.

nmap –F hostname

-F is for fast scan and this will not do any other scanning.

Example:

nmap -F 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) 
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.028s latency).
Not shown: 96 closed ports
PORT STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open telnet
53/tcp open domain
80/tcp open http
5000/tcp open upnp

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.10 seconds

Example6: Scan the machine and give as much details as possible.

nmap -v hostname

Example:

nmap -v 192.168.1.1

 Example7 : Scan a machine for TCP open ports

nmap –sT hostname

Here s stands for scanning and T is for scanning TCP ports only

Example:

nmap -sT 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
Host is up (0.022s latency).

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.28 seconds

Example8 : Scan a machine for UDP open ports.

nmap –sU hostname

Here U indicates UDP port scanning. This scanning requires root permissions.

Exmaple9 : Scanning for ports and to get what is the version of different services running on that machine

nmap –sV hostname

s stands for scaning and V indicates version of each network service running on that host

Example:

nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org )
Stats: 0:00:06 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (1 up), 1 undergoing Service Scan

Example10 : To check which protocol(not port) such as TCP, UDP, ICMP etc is supported by the remote machine. This -sO will give you the protocol supported and its open status.

#nmap –sO hostname

Example:

nmap -sO localhost

Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)

 Example11 : To scan a system for operating system and uptime details

nmap -O hostname

-O is for operating system scan along with default port scan

nmap -O google.com
